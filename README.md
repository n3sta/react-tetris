# Tetris game

I wrote one of my favorite skill game - tetris. It was my first contact with HTML5 canvas, audio and IndexedDB. There are a lot of cool features like control settings, level functionality, highscores and others. I used:

  - HTML5 cavas
  - IndexedDB
  - ReactJS
  - Redux
  - Styled components
